# Bike Sales Analysis
This code performs analysis on bike sales data loaded from an Excel file named "Bikesales.xlsx". It utilizes various libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation, visualization, and analysis.
## Dataset Information
The dataset consists of 1026 entries and 13 columns.
Columns include:
ID: Unique identifier for each entry.
MaritalStatus: Marital status of the customer.
Gender: Gender of the customer.
Income: Income of the customer.
Children: Number of children.
Education: Educational level of the customer.
Occupation: Occupation of the customer.

Cars: Number of cars owned by the customer.
CommuteDistance: Distance of commute to work.
Region: Region of the customer.
Age: Age of the customer.
PurchasedBike: Whether the customer purchased a bike or not.
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The code performs basic EDA tasks such as checking the dataset shape, data types, missing values, and descriptive statistics.
It explores unique values for categorical columns such as Education, Occupation, Region, Children, and CommuteDistance.
Visualizations are created to analyze the distribution and relationships between different variables:
Pie charts are used to visualize the distribution of Gender, MaritalStatus, PurchasedBike, and HomeOwner.
A heatmap is plotted to visualize the correlation between numerical features.

This code provides insights into bike sales data, including the demographic distribution of customers and correlations between different variables. These insights can be used to inform marketing strategies, target specific customer segments, and optimize sales approaches.
